# Official repository for Heptio Ark community meetings

## Ark Q&A

Happens on every 2nd Tuesday of every month at 4pm UTC. These public online meetings will be focused on: answering any Ark related questions you may have, or if you want to give us feedback verbally, or if you just want to hang out.

## Ark Design Session

These public meetings will be focused on a specific feature and will be a technical design discussion. We'll announce ahead of time what feature will be the topic for an upcoming meeting, so stay tunned. We will have these regularly and will figure out how often we need them.

## Info

The [index](playlist.md) contains a list of all meetings.

## Suggest an topic

If you have an idea for a topic of discussion please [open an issue in the Ark community issue tracker](https://github.com/heptio/ark-community/issues).
We generally pick topics around features we are working on but we can also see fit to talk about what is of interest in the Ark community.
If we select your suggestion we will give you a shoutout on during the online meeting!
